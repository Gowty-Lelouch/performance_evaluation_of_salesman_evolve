Since the business case and the  objectives doesn't seem to be in sync, I assume that the objective is to launch an app into a foreign market. Taking for Granted, assuming the app to be an 'E Commerce' App. Taking 'India' to be the current 'Market' and 'China' to be the Foreign market.

### Business plan

Assuming we have enough Capital to run Ads for a set period, let's start with the ads.

1. Instead of typical television ads, for the first two months, the money is spend on building a good official *Twitter Account* and **Sina Weibo** account. Since, chinese social media are more popular than their international alternatives, our ads should be targeting the locally popular social media platforms such **sina weibo, Xiaohongshu** etc..

2. Next, Spend some cash on giving **cashback offers** and promote those offers in these social sites. More the fan following merrier the outcome will be.

3. Start doing **popular** yet **controversial** stuffs like, **allowing cryptocurrency** as a payment method. This will spark a huge **advertisment campaign** (by crypto users) in forums such as reddit, 4chan, and will increase our popularity. Making a deal with any one popular but growing Cryptocurrency will enhance our reach further. Who doesn't want the word 'blockchain' in their ad these days.

4. Once enough fanbase (around 0.5M) has been reached, we can shift to traditional advertisements (keeping it to 10% of total ad spending).

5. Keep the company or app name in Local language.

## Risks

1. Chinese are Nationalists, just like Indians, and may hesitate to use an App which is not from their Country. Just like how Indians show a strong hate towards 'Alibaba Cloud' (can be seen on their facebook ads). That's why naming on local language may mitiage this to some extent.

2. There is already a very big home grown player 'Alibaba' which is establised too good. Having such a huge competition will make us things difficult. Hence, adding Crypto as payment option thereby attracting our very own crowd who respect privacy. This may not be a big following, but will give us some support.

3. Regulations are tighter in China, and Copyright violations aren't that uncommon. Can expect our App to be copied quite fast.

## Benefits

1. China is a very huge market and a very important one in Asia. It opens up to huge businesses.

2. Having our App in one more country makes us more stable in case of Changes in law or economy down in one country.

3. China has way higher GDP (ppp) than India, meaning their Purchasing power is quite high, and thus we can expect a bigger business.

4. China has better Infrastructure and as most products are produced there, it can help us expand our inventory at both countries.

5. Considering previous point, better infrastructure = less loss in transit and aquiring of products = Higher profit
